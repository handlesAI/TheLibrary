# TheLibrary

With The Library, you don't need to be a tech genius or a Time Lord to harness the power of AI. Just like the brave souls who ventured into the Library in search of knowledge, you too can embark on a journey of discovery and innovation with our AI projects. Our aim is to provide an all-encompassing AI environment that speaks to your every need.

With The Library, you don't need to be a tech genius or a Time Lord to harness the power of AI. Just like the brave souls who ventured into the Library in search of knowledge, you too can embark on a journey of discovery and innovation with our AI projects.

But beware â€“ just as the Vashta Nerada lurk in the shadows of the Library, the world of AI can be a daunting and complex place.

This repo is the main collection of AI projects for handlesAI. It also provide to you a simple, fast way to have the handlesAI selected projects working in your machine. The handlesAI-cli relies on this repo to be able to run and deploy the different apps.

## TODO:

- Explain the .env and .override.env system. Explain here the env variables to the general project.
- Add Readme to each app. Explain our Env variables for the app and link to the app documentation (also a explicit link to their env variables, if exists).
- Explain the caddy configuration. How to set your machine to work with real urls. Let the handles command that do this for you (in linux).
- Add a stable-diffusion app.
- Add observability.
- Provide kubernetes-helm and dokku-ansible scripts.
